# Goal

In one word: simplicity

The goal is to get my first bevy project in a "published" state.

### Gameplay simplicity

A very basic game where the goal would be, on a 2 plane, to get a point into a specific plane at regular intervals

### Graphics simplicity

Just the basic, a square of color for the player, a square of color for the target

Ideally, that would be swapped easily (yeah, particles, ascii art, I see you coming)
